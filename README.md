# task-manager
Web page on task manger
Here task2.html is the first webpage whose respective styling sheet is taskstyle1.css 
On clicking the login button on the first page and entering details it will lead you to second webpage which is task1.html whose respective styling sheet is taskstyle2.css
If signup button is clicked on the first webpage then it will lead to signup page and after entering the details it will lead to second webpage.
I have tried it out only with html and css. I have not connected the the backend part that is php and mysql and so it is just the visual representation of an actual task manager site.
